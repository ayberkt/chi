# 𝛘

Interpreter for a tiny language that makes it easy to define a self-interpreter.

𝛘 was first  formulated by Bengt Nordström. This interpreter follows [his notes](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2018/course/DIT311_Models_of_computation/reading/The_language_chi.pdf).

There is also [an Agda formalization of 𝛘][agda-formalization] by Nils Anders Danielsson. This is useful for formalizing uncomputability proofs in Agda.
